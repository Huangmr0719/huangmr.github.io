  title: "Memory Enhanced Visual-Speech Aggregation Model for Dense Video Captioning"
  venue: Under review
  description: "We introduce a novel Memory Enhanced Visual-Speech Aggregation model for dense video captioning, inspired by cognitive informatics on human memory recall. The model constructs a memory bank from ground truth captions and enhances visual representations by merging them with relevant text features retrieved through multimodal memory retrieval involving transcribed speech and visual inputs. A specialized Memory Enhancement Transformer facilitates the integration of visual features with these multimodal retrieval features. "
